Credit to Index-Zero for the code. This is not my original code.

This folder will contain custom code for react snippets that I personally like. My todos in this folder.

1)Learn how to create folders in github. 

2)Upload my projects directly to github instead of adding files.

3)Only add useful files. Since creating a react project creates many files, todo 2) may not be the most efficient. I could only add certain files and folders (although it may be confusing when trying to use snippets in a project). Thus learning to be more organized and regularily cleaning up this git will be crucial.
