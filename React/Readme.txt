Credit to Index-Zero for the code. This is not my original code.

This folder will contain custom code for react snippets that I personally like. My todos in this folder.

1)Learn how to create folders in github. 

2)Upload my projects directly to github instead of adding files.

3)Only add useful files. Since creating a react project creates many files, todo 2) may not be the most efficient. I could only add certain files and folders (although it may be confusing when trying to use snippets in a project). Thus learning to be more organized and regularily cleaning up this git will be crucial.

4)Create my own Card using props with CSS styling.

5)Create my own Nav Bar using state.
